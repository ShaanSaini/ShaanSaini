- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShaanSaini
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering of all kinds.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about developing software applications generally-speaking.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Projects which focus on empowering individuals. Software is the most powerful tool that we can use to help humanity.
With software, we can create tools to empower individuals to achieve whatever goals they wish to achieve. Software is beautiful, and I want to take part in the
process to help give power to individual people via software creation.
